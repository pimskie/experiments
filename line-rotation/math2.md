# Slope Intercept Form
* points: (3,7) and (5,11)
* equation: y = mx + b


## Calculate slope
* m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
* m = 2

## Calculate y-intecept
* y = mx + b
* y = (2 * x) + b
* 7 = (2 * 3) + b // 10 = (2 * 4) + b
* b = 7 - (2 * 6) = 1
* b = 1

## solve
y = (2 * 7) + 1

## Convert from slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) to standard form (Ax + By = C)
